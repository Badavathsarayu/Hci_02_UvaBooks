                In Sanskrit, ‘rudra’ means Lord Shiva and ‘aksh’ means tears or eyes. Rudraksha is revered 
                as Lord Shiva’s tears, so wearing them is believed to end sorrows and heal ailments.
                Delve into the heart of rudraksha’s symbolism, as this sacred bead is not just an accessory
                 but a powerful symbol of spirituality. Whether worn individually, as a necklace, or
                 a bracelet, rudraksha is revered for its ability to usher in material success,  physical ailments
                  and bring serenity to the mind.

                In times of adversity, you have two choices - you can either steal yourself away from the situation or steel yourself up towards it. 
                For Ratan Tata, the choice was made early on. To be given the reins to India's largest business conglomerate can be extremely daunting.
                 But Ratan Tata's takeover as the chairman of the Tata group proved that what is already great can be made even better.
                 His legacy has the innate power to inspire great leadership. His success can motivate any beyond words.</div>
